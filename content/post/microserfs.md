Microserfs<br />by Douglas Coupland<br /><br />"And once again, work is providing us with a comforting sense of normalcy -- living and working inside of coding's predictably segmented time/space. Simply grinding away at something makes life feel stable, even though the external particulars of life (like our paychecks, our office, and so forth) are, at best, random."<br />pg. 135<br /><br />"The industry is made up of either gifted techies or smart generalists -- the people whop were bored with high school --- the sort of people the teacher was always telling, "Now, Abe, you could get As if you really wanted to. Why don't you just apply yourself?" Look for these people --- the talented generalists. They're good as project and product managers. They're the same people who would have gone into advertising in 1973."<br />pg. 295
