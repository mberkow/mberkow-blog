However, seeing as <a href="http://www.whiskycast.com/">Mark Gillespie</a> was kind enough to include me in the latest <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mpgillespie">WhiskyCast HD</a>&nbsp; and <a href="http://www.whiskycast.com/files/WhiskyCast_20111211.mp3">WhiskyCast</a>, I thought this title was better.<br /><br />I paid a little more that I wanted for the Lot of two bottles of Four Grain and one of the&nbsp;Sonoma&nbsp;Cutter. I was surprised that the internet bids ran it up to over $300 to start. But at the end I figured $10 more than my limit was worth it! I still have to complete the transaction so I'll report back on that process. Overall &nbsp;a fun&nbsp;experience&nbsp;that I would do again.</div>
