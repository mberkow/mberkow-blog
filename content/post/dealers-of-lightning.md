<br />(Alan) Kay observed, "Everybody has to be able to play the whole game. Each person should have certain things they're better at than the others, but everyone should be pretty good at everything."
<br />pg. 116
<br />
<br />"In the course of one frustrating encounter (Alan) Kay blurted out the line destined to become his (and PARC's) unofficial credo. "Look," he said, "the best way to predict the future is to <span style="font-style: italic;">invent </span>it!"
<br />pg. 122
<br />

A Class Two disagreement is when each <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> explain to the other's satisfaction the other's point of view. Class Two disagreements enable people to work together even when they disagree. Class One is destructive."
<br />pg. 182
