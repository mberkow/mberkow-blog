One year ago I resolved to begin producing on the internet. So I started an [Instagram account](http://instagram.com/mendy_drinks) to chronicle my attempts at making cocktails. Now one year and 83 cocktails later I've grown my bar and my skills. But being a nerd I also had to pull some stats.

* I've made 83 different cocktails
* The most commonly used ingredient in Lemon Juice (31)
* The most commonly used alcohol ingredient is Gin (23)
* I've used 33 unique ingredients not including bitters
* The smallest cocktail had three ingredients
* The largest cocktail had eight ingredients
* I've sourced the most cocktails from [Cocktail Virgin Blog](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/) (23) with [Common Man Cocktails](http://everydaydrinkers.com/) coming in second (13)


I owe much of my inspiration to those two sources. Vastly different styles and backgrounds even if they are relatively nearby geographically. If you can find a way to support them you should.

Looking forward to the next year!
