<span style="font-weight: bold;">Blink</span><br />Malcom Gladwell<br /><br />"We like market research because it provides certainty -- a score, a prediction; if someone asks us why we made the decision we did, we can point to a number. But the truth is that for the most important decisions, there can be no certainty."<br />pg. 176<br /><br />"... if we can control the environment in which rapid cognition takes place then we can control rapid cognition."<br />pg. 253
