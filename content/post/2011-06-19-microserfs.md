# Microserfs
by Douglas Coupland


"And once again, work is providing us with a comforting sense of normalcy -- living and working inside of coding's predictably segmented time/space. Simply grinding away at something makes life feel stable, even though the external particulars of life (like our paychecks, our office, and so forth) are, at best, random."  
pg. 135


"The industry is made up of either gifted techies or smart generalists -- the people whop were bored with high school --- the sort of people the teacher was always telling, "Now, Abe, you could get As if you really wanted to. Why don't you just apply yourself?" Look for these people --- the talented generalists. They're good as project and product managers. They're the same people who would have gone into advertising in 1973."
