<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">One year ago I resolved to begin producing on the internet. So I started an <a href="http://instagram.com/mendy_drinks">Instagram account</a> to chronicle my attempts at making cocktails. Now one year and 83 cocktails later I've grown my bar and my skills. But being a nerd I also had to pull some stats..<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>I've made 83 different cocktails</li><li>The most commonly used ingredient in Lemon Juice (31)</li><li>The most commonly used alcohol ingredient is Gin (23)</li><li>I've used 33 unique ingredients not including bitters</li><li>The smallest cocktail had three ingredients</li><li>The largest cocktail had eight ingredients</li><li>I've sourced the most cocktails from <a href="http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/">Cocktail Virgin Blog</a> (23) with <a href="http://everydaydrinkers.com/">Common Man Cocktails</a> coming in second (13)</li></ul><div>I owe much of my inspiration to those two sources. Vastly different styles and backgrounds even if they are relatively nearby geographically. If you can find a way to support them you should.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Looking forward to the next year!</div></div>
