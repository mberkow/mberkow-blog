This is now the sixth year of my "reading report". Certainly long enough to be called the "annual reading report". I surpassed my goal of 40 books by reading 44 books. I'm struggling to pick a goal for next year. Currently I have Goodreads set to 40 which is slightly below the six year average of 42. I hope to push myself this year and surpass the goal again. Here is the Goodreads produced a [My Year in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2022/3063249) 

Several things stand out to me as I review the list of books. I discovered several new authors and tried to read much of their catalog. I read multiple books about Jews and Judaism. I expect these trends to continue. I read multiple books with fewer than 200 pages. This probably helped with the overall book count but is reflected in the comparisons to last year.


Here are the stats with the change from the previous year in parentheses.
