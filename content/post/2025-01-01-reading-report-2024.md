As is custom here is my "Reading Report for 2024. Another challenging year in terms of reaching my goal. I pushed hard to finish a book on the last day of the year so that it would not carry over. I'm not a big believer in setting unachievable goals, so this year I will strive for a more realistic number. [My Year in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/3063249).
