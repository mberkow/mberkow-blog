# Meatball Sundae
by Seth Gudin


"Oprah is a superstar because she has the power (the right? the expectation?) of regularly putting new ideas in front of people who weren't looking for that particular thing."  
pg. 65


"Your job will be to convert that momentary attention into long term permission and then into action. The question, then, isn't how you get Dugg. The question is how do you make stuff worth Digging."  pg. 82


"Add to that the pickup from the broadcast media (which picked it up because it was popular, not because it was "important")"  
pg. 89
