Now in year three of what has become a yearly tradition here is the stats breakdown of the books I read in 2019. After reaching my reading goal of 40 books last year I missed my goal this year. I read 37 books out of my goal of 40. It would be easy to blame the shortfall on the disruptions in my lodgings but in reality I think I hit the same fall wall as I did the previous two years. 

Last year I set myself two goals. First to read at least five new fiction authors. I blew through this goal reading 8 authors for the first time. This was greatly helped by my book club at work which is a great way to be forced to read things I might not otherwise find. The second goal was to write a blurb about each book. While I started strong I only did this for the first two months. I am going to resurrect both goals for 2020. 

The reading challenge remains a motivation and my work flow for managing the reading list becomes more mature and robust. I'm going to keep the 40 books goal for 2020. 

Here are the stats with the change from the previous year in parentheses.

* Books Read: 37 (-3)

* Mean Book Length: 391 (+12)
* Median Book Length: 364 (+18)
* Month with most books read:  February/March/June (5)
