## Summary
A survey of different building and engineering techniques. Multiple concepts are explained in simple terms, interspersed with anecdotes and pictures.  

## Thoughts
It is fun to read a book written by someone passionate about the subject. The energy of the author comes out on the page in a way that makes the book a pleasure to read. I certainly won't look at buildings the same again. I enjoyed the hand drawn diagrams that would explain the concepts and they were seamlessly woven into the narrative. 

## Final Word
I'm giving this a 3/5 stars on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921647-built). I had fun reading this book but unless people are already interested in engineering and buildings I'm not sure they would enjoy the book.
