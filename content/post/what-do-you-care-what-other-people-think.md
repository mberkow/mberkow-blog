<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">What Do <u>You</u> Care What Other People Think<br />Richard P. Feynman<br /><br />"That story was probably incorrect in <i>detail</i>, but what he was telling me was right in <i>principle</i>."<br />pg. 15<br /><br />"Your situation is just an accident of life."<br />pg. 51<br /><br />"They got all excited and began to describe the problem to me. I'm sure they were delighted, because technical people love to discuss technical problems with technical people who might have an opinion or suggestion that could be useful."<br />pg. 185<br /><br />"Changes are&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;because they require extensive testing. The proper way to save money is to curtail the number of requested changes, not the quality of testing for each."<br />pg. 235</div>
