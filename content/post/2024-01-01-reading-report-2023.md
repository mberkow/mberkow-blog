Now in the seventh year of my "reading report" I didn't intend for it to be a "sabbatical". I missed my goal by quite a bit. Not surprisingly I basically read nothing in October or November as I was distracted by current events. [My Year in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2023/3063249). The foundation is still fundamentally sound and I plan to strive for 40 books in 2024.


Here are the stats with the change from the previous year in parentheses.

* Books Read: 29 (-15)
* Fiction Books: 19 (-8)
* Non-Fiction Books: 10 (+7)
* Pages Read: 10,996 (-4,297)
* Longest Book: 608 (Lords of Uncreation)
* Shortest Book: 160 (The Vietnam War A Graphic History)
* Mean Book Length: 379	(+31)
* Median Book Length: 350 (+2)
* Month with most books read:  January (5)
* Month with fewest books read: October (0)
