Einstein
Walter Issacson

Resist being credulous. "When you pick up an application," Haller instructed, "think that everything the inventor says is wrong."  
pg. 79


"America is incomparably less endangered by its own Communists than by the hysterical hunt for the few Communists that are here."  
pg. 533
