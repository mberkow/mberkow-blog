Einstein<br />Walter Issacson<br /><br />"You have to remain critically vigilant." Question every premise, challenge conventional wisdom, and never accept the truth of something merely because everyone else views it as obvious. Resist being credulous. "When you pick up an application," Haller instructed, "think that everything the inventor says is wrong."<br />pg. 79<br /><br />"America is incomparably less endangered by its own Communists than by the hysterical hunt for the few Communists that are here."<br />pg. 533
