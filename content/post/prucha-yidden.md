When I was watching the Ranger game Saturday night the announcers were mumbling about some "Prucha Song" they played when Prucha scored a goal. So last night in between periods they showed a clip of their ice level reporter dancing to the song which they said was by a '70 disco band about Ghengis Khan.<br /><br />Yup you guessed it: Yidden! Looking to download the torrent from last nights game to get confirmation.
