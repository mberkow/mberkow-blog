  <div class="summary"> Many people use the phrase &ldquo;Catch-22&rdquo; to describe a choice with no good options. But the true definition of the phrase is surprisingly captured by the dictionary.com entry:
&ldquo;A situation in which a desired outcome or solution is impossible to
attain because of a set of inherently illogical rules or
conditions&rdquo;
In the book the Catch for Yossarian is that to not want to fly means you are not crazy therefore not eligible for the craziness excuse for not flying. </div>

Page 14: &ldquo;The abolitionists were not interested in reform. They were interested in conversion&rdquo;
Page 26: &ldquo;On [Holmes&rsquo;s] view, successful people, like Morgan an d Rockefeller, just had a better grasp of social tendencies than unsuccessful people did. Everyone is simply riding the wave chance has put them on. Some people know how to surf; some people drown.&rdquo;

  <div class="summary"> There is a well known adage that three versions exist to any disagreement. What the first party believes happened, what the second party believed happened and the truth. As a corollary to this I have always felt that when it came to news from Israel by reading the Haaretz, Jerusalem Post and Arutz Sheva somewhere in the middle would be what really happened.
With my recent trip to Israel and the recent happenings in Amona I think this system is coming under attack. </div>

  <div class="summary"> So found the following YNet Article via Josh.
I guess this is one time when my bourbon preference comes in handy. As per US Law bourbon must be made in NEW Oak casks.
It is pretty funny that the picture they use with the article is of a bottle of Gentleman Jack which while not technically a bourbon still adhears to the bourbon standard but is charcoal filtered. </div>

  <div class="summary"> When I was watching the Ranger game Saturday night the announcers were mumbling about some &ldquo;Prucha Song&rdquo; they played when Prucha scored a goal. So last night in between periods they showed a clip of their ice level reporter dancing to the song which they said was by a &lsquo;70 disco band about Ghengis Khan.
Yup you guessed it: Yidden! Looking to download the torrent from last nights game to get confirmation. </div>

  <div class="summary"> Figured I would take advantage of my blog to keep a rolling record of my trip. This way when my wife asks me what I did I will have some way of remembering.
The flight was decent. Had a middle seat but that didn&rsquo;t cause to many problems as neither of my row-mates were 700lbs old ladies. Slept through dinner and most of the flight which is better than last time. </div>

  <div class="summary"> When we last left you, your fearless hero was taking a breather after downing three shots is quick succession. Having tasted the new stuff it was time to visit old friends. First on the list was Heaven Hill. Notable for their 18yr Single Barrel Elijah Wood which I picked up after last Whiskey Fest and saved for a special occasion (the birth of my daughter). They were show casing two new offerings. </div>

  <div class="summary"> So once we were out of the Glenrothes session my uncle had to go meet a friend of his. This was accomplished fairly quickly and the three of us tried the Laphroig table again. Unfortunately they were out of the Cask strength that they were pouring. So we had to settle for the 10 year old single barrel. Not being much of a Scotch connoisseur I didn&rsquo;t know what to think. </div>
