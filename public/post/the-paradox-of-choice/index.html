&ldquo;Moreover, I think the adding of options brings with it a subtle shift in the responsibility that employers feel toward their employees. When the employer is providing only a few roues to retirement security, it seems important to take responsibility for the quality of those routes. But when the employer takes the trouble to provide many routes, then it seems reasonable to think that by providing options, the employer has done hsi or her part." />

    <div class="content"> <p>The Paradox of Choice Why More is Less<br />Barry Schwartz<br /><br />&ldquo;Moreover, I think the adding of options brings with it a subtle shift in the responsibility that employers feel toward their employees. When the employer is providing only a few roues to retirement security, it seems important to take responsibility for the quality of those routes. But when the employer takes the trouble to provide many routes, then it seems reasonable to think that by providing options, the employer has done hsi or her part. Choosing wisely among those options becomes the employee&rsquo;s responsibility.&rdquo;<br />pg. 28<br /><br />&ldquo;A satisficer may be just as discriminating as a maximizer. The difference between the two types is that a satisficer is content with the merely excellent as opposed to the absolute best.&rdquo;<br />pg. 78<br /><br />&ldquo;Part of the downside of abundant choice is that each new option adds to the list of trade-offs, and trade-offs have psychological consequences. The necessity of making trade-offs alter how we feel about the decisions we face; more important, it affects the level of satisfaction we experiance for the decisions we ultimately make.&rdquo;<br />pg. 119<br /><br />&ldquo;It is a thrill to drive your new car for the first few weeks; after that it&rsquo;s just comfortable. It certainly beats the old car, but it isn&rsquo;t much of a kick. Comnfort is nice enough, but people want pleasure and comfort isn&rsquo;t pleasure.&rdquo;<br />pg. 172</p>
