After missing my reading goal last year I attempted to set a more realistic goal this year of 40 books. Considering I read 45 books last year I thought hitting 40 would be easy. I completed the challenge just under the wire finishing book number 40 with two days to spare. I hit a similar wall this year in the November time frame, although I don’t have the excuse of being tripped up by a Brandon Sanderson tome. Once again the challenge was a motivation to read and to set aside time to read. I do think that 40 books is the sweet spot as a goal and I’m going to repeat the attempt next year.

Once again here are some stats with the change from the previous year in parentheses.

* Books Read: 40 (-4)
* Fiction Books: 28 (+5)
* Non-Fiction Books: 12 (-9)
* Pages Read: 15,145 (-2,791)
* Longest Book: 909 (A Column of Fire)
* Shortest Book: 102 (The Lessons of History)
* Mean Book Length: 379 (-28)
* Median Book Length: 346 (-34)
* Month with most books read:  February/September/December (5)
* Month with fewest books read: October (1)

Two of the deltas from last year strike me as interesting. The ration of Fiction to Non-Fiction was rather skewed this year towards Fiction. Not sure why this happened but it will be something I pay attention to next year. The difference in total number of pages read can’t be fully explained by the difference in books read. I wonder if not reading a Sanderson book has that effect.

For next year in addition to number of books read I’m setting two additional goals. First I want to read at least five new fiction authors. I don’t want to get lost in  catching up on what some newly discovered authors have written and keeping up with various series and trilogies. Second I want to write some blurb about every book I read. It might not be a review or a summary but something to help me remember the book and how I felt after reading.
