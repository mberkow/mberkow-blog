There is a good reason for this being delayed. As usual my co-workers were curious about Whiskey Fest and I gave them my three cardinal sins:

* Go with a plan. It is easy to get overwhelmed and boxed out if you don't know what you are after.
* Don't get drunk. There is nothing sadder then seeing the drunken idiots staggering around.
* Whatever you do don't forget what you saw, smelled and tasted


Well of course I go ahead and violate rule number 3! I had the little booklet and was writing down my notes. At some point after going to the Bourbon trail booth I reached into my bag for the book and discovered it wasn't there! ARGH!


Anyway spent most of the train ride home reconstructing what I had done. It wasn't easy, it isn't as good and I'm sure I missed stuff but it is better then nothing.


Before I get started with the notes there are two people I need to thank. First as always is Uncle Alan for introducing me to Whiskey Fest and for getting me the tickets. Even though we only see each other there for about 5 minutes total it wouldn't be the same without him.


Also I have to thank Aron. He was a good sport tagging around to all the Bourbon booths and it was nice to have a friend to share the thoughts and observations. I didn't go planning to covert him to Bourbon but now that we have started the prospect isn't unpleasing!


Enough with the preliminaries now on the the Whiskey!
