I've changed the "blog quote". Retiring the old tired mainstay and moving on to something more appropriate.<br /><br />It take more than a little ego for some one to blog, assuming that your thoughts, ideas and comments actually have meaning. I was always struck by this quote from Stephen King's the Dark Half. I was always able to relate it to the Stand. When any one reads the Stand or watches any of the disaster films I am sure they imagine themselves as one of the survivors not of the faceless victims.<br /><br />Blogging, especially public blogging while possibly pleasing to others is mostly pleasing to yourself.
