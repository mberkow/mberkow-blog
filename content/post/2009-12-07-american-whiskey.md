Is it just me or were there no American whiskeys on the Malt Maniacs awards? Based on the interview on Whiskey Cast they had Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Australian whiskeys. Looking at the list I didn't recognize any American companies. Do they not submit, are they not eligible or are they not good enough to crack an 80 score? The person being interviewed did talk about how Whiskeys from Australia are getting better and taste less like "Australian whiskey" than "whiskey"  


Don't think anything nefarious is going on and don't think there is a conspiracy but it is confusing.  
(I know I need to post the notes from Whiskey Fest.  Maybe if iPhone blogging works I can do it from the train.)
