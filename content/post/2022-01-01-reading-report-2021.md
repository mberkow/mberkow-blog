As is now tradition here are the stats of the books I read in 2021. I did not reach my goal of 45 books falling short by three books. Goodreads produced a [My Year in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2021/3063249) which has much of the same data I typically post here. Perhaps the additional non-fiction books contributed towards the reduced total. I don't usually write reviews or pick a top list but looking back over the list so many titles were excellent reads. 

Once again setting the goal for next year is a difficult choice. I'm going to try to make sure I hit my goal this year and am choosing a goal for 40 books for 2022.

Here are the stats with the change from the previous year in parentheses.

* Books Read: 42 (-5)

* Shortest Book: 76 (The Dip)
* Mean Book Length: 405 (-18)
* Median Book Length: 385 (+11)
* Month with most books read:  September (6)
* Month with fewest books read: December/March (2)
