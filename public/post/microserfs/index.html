&ldquo;And once again, work is providing us with a comforting sense of normalcy &ndash; living and working inside of coding&rsquo;s predictably segmented time/space. Simply grinding away at something makes life feel stable, even though the external particulars of life (like our paychecks, our office, and so forth) are, at best, random.&rdquo;
pg. 135
&ldquo;The industry is made up of either gifted techies or smart generalists &ndash; the people whop were bored with high school &mdash; the sort of people the teacher was always telling, &ldquo;Now, Abe, you could get As if you really wanted to." />
