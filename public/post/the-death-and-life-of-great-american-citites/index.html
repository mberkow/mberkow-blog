Since the strange leads to questions and undermines familiar tradition, it servers to elevate reason to ultimate significance &hellip; There is no better proof of this fact than the attempts of all totalitarian authorities to keep the strange from their subjects &hellip; The big city is sliced into pieces, each of which is observed, purged and equalized. The mystery of the strange and the critical rationality of men are both removed from the city.&rdquo;<br />Paul J. Tillich pg. 238<br /><br />&rdquo; A fool can put on his own clothes better than a wise man can do it for him.&rdquo;<br />Marshall Shaffer pg. 324</p>
