So found the following [YNet Article](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3208523,00.html) via [Josh](http://yutopia.yucs.org)


I guess this is one time when my bourbon preference comes in handy. As per [US Law](ttp://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/05dec20031700/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/aprqtr/27cfr5.22.htm) bourbon must be made in _NEW_ Oak casks.


It is pretty funny that the picture they use with the article is of a bottle of Gentleman Jack which while not technically a bourbon still adhears to the bourbon standard but is charcoal filtered.
