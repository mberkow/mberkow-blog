My comment on this <a href="http://www.whatdoesjohnknow.com/2010/08/30/guest-blog-1-most-craft-whiskeys-suck">post</a><br /><br />"Sourcing and blending are real skills " Indeed they are, and in Scotland they have a name for people who specialize in those skills: Independent Bottlers. I don't understand why companies are insisting on the Micro Distiller label over the Independent Bottler label. It isn't as if they are mutually exclusive. At least then awards and tastings can categorize the whiskeys correctly.<br /><br />Does the US have an Independent Bottling tradition?
