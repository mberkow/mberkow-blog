Many people use the phrase "Catch-22" to describe a choice with no good options. But the true definition of the phrase is surprisingly captured by the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=Catch-22">dictionary.com</a> entry:<br /><em><em><blockquote><em><em>"A situation in which a desired outcome or solution is impossible to<br />attain because of a set of inherently illogical rules or<br />conditions"</em><br /></em></blockquote></em></em>In the book the Catch for Yossarian is that to not want to fly means you are not crazy therefore not eligible for the craziness excuse for not flying. I try to avoid using the phrase "Catch-22" b/c I don't often come across what I consider to be true "Catch-22"s.<br /><br />I guess that the floor I sit on in addition to having a great view has inspired my first "Catch-22". Namely: to survive the job you have to stop caring, however to stop caring is to stop doing the job.
