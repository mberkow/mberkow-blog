Many people use the phrase "Catch-22" to describe a choice with no good options. But the true definition of the phrase is surprisingly captured by the [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=Catch-22) entry:

> A situation in which a desired outcome or solution is impossible to attain because of a set of inherently illogical rules or conditions"

In the book the Catch for Yossarian is that to not want to fly means you are not crazy therefore not eligible for the craziness excuse for not flying. I try to avoid using the phrase "Catch-22" b/c I don't often come across what I consider to be true "Catch-22"s  
I guess that the floor I sit on in addition to having a great view has inspired my first "Catch-22". Namely: to survive the job you have to stop caring, however to stop caring is to stop doing the job.
