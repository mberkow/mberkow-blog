Been wanting to blog this from [UniWatch](http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2007/01/09/what-is-it-they-have-in-europe-oh-right-taste/). I actually think [this](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/152/351634705_9c3ef6d626_o.jpg) is a good idea. This way the opposing team knows who to hit and who to defend. With all the matching lines that go on in the NHL it would be much tougher to sneak your top scorer on for a double shift. On the other hand for the casual fans it may be a heads up to pay attention to the star player.
