What a year. Here is the stats breakdown of the books I read in 2020. Surprisingly with all that happened I exceeded my goal and read 47 books. Goodreads produced a [My Year in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2020/3063249) which has much of the same data I typically post here. 

I didn't track towards my other goals for the year and I doubt that I will attempt them again. Setting the goal for next year is a difficult choice. 47 books in a year is the most books in the four years I have been tracking my reading. Will I have less time in 2021? I am going to set a 45 book goal. 

Here are the stats with the change from the previous year in parentheses.

* Books Read: 47 (+10)

* Shortest Book: 193 (Winter's Bone)
* Mean Book Length: 423 (+32)
* Median Book Length: 374 (+10)
* Month with most books read:  March (8)
* Month with fewest books read: December/February (1)
