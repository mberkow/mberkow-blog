    <div class="content"> <p>Figured I would take advantage of my blog to keep a rolling record of my trip. This way when my wife asks me what I did I will have some way of remembering.<br /><br />The flight was decent. Had a middle seat but that didn&rsquo;t cause to many problems as neither of my row-mates were 700lbs old ladies. Slept through dinner and most of the flight which is better than last time. We barely had a minyan on the plane which was surprising. In the end I think there were 14-17 men who participated. The plane was packed with birthright people so that may have skewed the normal dati/non-dati ratios.<br /><br />Landed at the new Ben-Gurion airport. It was certainly different than the old stairs and bus routine. The old routine defiantly did something to contribute to Israel&rsquo;s image as a primitive earthy land. Now perhaps they are going for the glass and steel look. Some of the halls you need to walk through are interesting. Especially this 100m+ pair of ramps. But you do have to hike quite a bit to get to the passport control which looks exactly like it used to.<br /><br />Getting the bags was easy and it was off to Efrat. Chezkie only badgered me once regarding MBA. It was a sign of how busy Davida was that she didn&rsquo;t mention it when I spoke to her today. We&rsquo;ll see what shabbos brings. Went to bed at 10:45 and woke up at 4:30. Lets hope tonight is a little better.</p>
