"Uncontrolled competition, like unregulated liberty, is not really free."<br />pg. 88<br /><br />"When quarreling parties are both in the wrong, and are assailed with blame ... they will do strange things to save their faces."<br />Grover Cleveland pg. 167<br /><br />"Roosevelt cared little for Korea, a little, impotent kingdom that fancied itself an empire -- and even less for China. But he was aware that the latter was potentially the world's greatest market."<br />pg. 245<br /><br />"I do not represent public opinion: I represent the public. There is a wide difference between the two, between the real interests of the public, and the public's opinion of these interests. I must represent no the excited opinion of the West but the real interests of the whole people."<br />Theodore Roosevelt pg. 434<br /><br />"Idealism bordering on fanaticism"<br />"The eyes do not look as if they read books," Owen Wister wrote, "but as if they gazed upon a Cause."<br />pg. 486
