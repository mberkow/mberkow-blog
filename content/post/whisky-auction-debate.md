<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">        <br /><div class="p1">It has been the month of auctions. First a couple of good points from others:</div><div class="p2"></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Great <a href="http://www.whiskyadvocateblog.com/2011/12/14/whisky-as-an-investment-are-we-in-a-bubble/#comment-132425">comment</a> from <a href="http://www.recenteats.blogspot.com/">sku</a> on John Hansell's <a href="http://www.whiskyadvocateblog.com/">blog</a> about how general collecting works</li><li>Great <a href="http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2011/12/15/sound-investment.html">blog post</a> by <a href="http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/">David Driscoll</a> extending the analogy to pop culture</li><li>Would have rather been known as a "Whisky Fan" not a "Whisky Collector" in story board from the Whisky Cast HD</li><li>I recall a point <a href="http://www.ralfy.com/">Ralfy's</a>&nbsp;made about buying whiskey now and saving it for later when it will no longer be available. I think it was in episode <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3L_SMwy8dk">137A</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AR6lY39stQ">137B</a></li></ul><br /><div class="p1">My thoughts are an amalgamation of the above. It is why I try to buy two bottles of those whiskeys I want to save.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Originally I tried to grab one each of the new whiskeys coming onto the market. I had the Templeton, Redemption and R1 ryes. I had all of the Tuthilltown expressions. I had the Red Stag and American Honey. But in the end I realized that these are standard expressions and that I would be able to find them easily in the future. On the other hand you have things that US independent bottlers have discovered (High West whiskeys &amp; Whistle Pig) or special expressions (Wild Turkey, Buffalo Trace). These are not standard offerings and will not be available in the future. To experience these in 20 years you have to buy them now and put them aside.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">this is why I bought the whiskeys at auction. They are rare and I want the opportunity to taste it in the future. I think I expressed my philosophy on Whisky Cast, in 20 or 30 years if I want to sell them or open them I will have the option then.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div></div>
