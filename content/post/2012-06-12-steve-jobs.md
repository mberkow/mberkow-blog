Steve Jobs  
Walter Isaacson


Steve wasn't much of an engineer himself, but he was very good at assessing people's answers. He could tell whether the engineers were defensive or unsure of themselves.  
Pg 100

"Steve had a tendency to look at vulnerabilities and neuroses and turn them into spiritual attributes."  
Joanna Hoffman pg. 263
