So found the following <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3208523,00.html">YNet Article</a> via <a href="http://yutopia.yucs.org">Josh</a>.<br /><br />I guess this is one time when my bourbon preference comes in handy. As per <a href="http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/05dec20031700/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/aprqtr/27cfr5.22.htm">US Law</a> bourbon must be made in <i>NEW</i> Oak casks.<br /><br />It is pretty funny that the picture they use with the article is of a bottle of Gentleman Jack which while not technically a bourbon still adhears to the bourbon standard but is charcoal filtered.
