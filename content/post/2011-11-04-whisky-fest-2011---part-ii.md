Part 2 ([Part 1](http://mberkow.blogspot.com/2011_11_01_archive.html#8799654670216361767))


One of the first timers was Breckenridge Colorado Whiskey. Sweet nose and very smooth. They said it was 3.5 years old but it tasted much older. Not from the wood character which wasn't there but it was much smoother than I would have expected. It didn't have the rough edges that you expect from a young whiskey. I didn't note the ABV but it must not have been that high. I was impressed by the quality and this became the first bottle to make the wish list (I had already ordered the PH so that didn't count).


Four Roses Special Release. It wasn't bad but wasn't special either. At first they thought they only had a tiny drop left and went looking for another bottle. After about three minutes they realized that Jim Rutledge was holding an open bottle the whole time.


I stopped but the Jefferson's booth to compliment them on the special bottling they did for Park Avenue. I noticed they had a Rye on the table. I hadn't realized that they made a Rye. It was a 10 year old Rye called "American Rye". It had a lot of Rye Bread flavor. It wasn't overly sweet and being so late in the evening I didn't note down if it was woody. Definitely on the wish list.


Last one I have real notes for was Catoction Creek Rye. I noticed that sickly sweet taste on the front. Reminded me of the McKenzie Rye from finger lakes. I wonder if that is a characteristics of young ryes. The Jefferson's didn't have that taste at all and neither does the Wild Turkey Ryes. They said it was in the barrel for four months but the color was way to dark for that.
