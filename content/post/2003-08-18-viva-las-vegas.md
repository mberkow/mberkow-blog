Great trip, made even greater that I walked away with $50 from the black jack tables :) 


This was my first "photo trip" where my goal was to take as many quality pictures as possible. I took 200 pictures with my SLR and 250 with my new Canon S400, so far the results are promising. The only thing I regret is leaving my wide angle lens in the car at the Hoover Dam. I could have used it! 


Driving the the Grand Canyon was loads of fun as well. I set a new personal speed record and would have hit triple digits had the car not been fully loaded with people and baggage. 


As everyone else we got hit by the blackout for our return trip. We were like those people on the 5 o'clock news sleeping in the airport waiting for our flight. Thankfully we were only delayed 4 hours.
