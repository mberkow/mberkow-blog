    <div class="content"> <p>Great trip, made even greater that I walked away with $50 from the black jack tables :)
<br />
<br />This was my first &ldquo;photo trip&rdquo; where my goal was to take as many quality pictures as possible. I took 200 pictures with my SLR and 250 with my new Canon S400, so far the results are promising. The only thing I regret is leaving my wide angle lens in the car at the Hoover Dam. I could have used it!
<br />
<br />Driving the the Grand Canyon was loads of fun as well. I set a new personal speed record and would have hit triple digits had the car not been fully loaded with people and baggage.
<br />
<br />As everyone else we got hit by the blackout for our return trip. We were like those people on the 5 o&rsquo;clock news sleeping in the airport waiting for our flight. Thankfully we were only delayed 4 hours.</p>
