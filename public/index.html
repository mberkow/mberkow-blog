  <div class="summary"> One year ago I resolved to begin producing on the internet. So I started an Instagram account to chronicle my attempts at making cocktails. Now one year and 83 cocktails later I've grown my bar and my skills. But being a nerd I also had to pull some stats..
I've made 83 different cocktailsThe most commonly used ingredient in Lemon Juice (31)The most commonly used alcohol ingredient is Gin (23)I've used 33 unique ingredients not including bittersThe smallest cocktail had three ingredientsThe largest cocktail had eight ingredientsI've sourced the most cocktails from Cocktail Virgin Blog (23) with Common Man Cocktails coming in second (13)I owe much of my inspiration to those two sources. </div>

  <div class="summary"> I remember watching a documentary (or maybe it was Pushing Tin) about air traffic controllers who passed around small pieces of paper with flight information. As an aircraft would transition from approach to ground control to departure the triangles would be passed from person to person.
Last night my team moved 27 critical pieces of&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;that run our entire&nbsp;business.&nbsp;It took us countless hours of prep and five hours of execution. We needed a way to keep the entire company informed of our progress, coordinate three different teams and make sure our bosses had enough information to keep off our backs. </div>

Clayton M. Christensen
"For instance, is a notebook better than a mainframe? This is an ambiguous question because the notebook computer established a completely new performance trajectory, with a definition of performance that differs substantially from the way mainframe performance is measured."pg. 9&nbsp;"Three factors - the promise of upmarket margins, the simultaneous upmarket movement of many of a company's customers, and the difficulty of cutting costs to move downmarket profitably - together create powerful barriers to downward mobility. </div>

  <div class="summary"> Was going to title this "Three times, Sold!" as I won the auction for the Woodford Reserve&nbsp;Four Grain. However, seeing as Mark Gillespie was kind enough to include me in the latest WhiskyCast HD&nbsp; and WhiskyCast, I thought this title was better.
I paid a little more that I wanted for the Lot of two bottles of Four Grain and one of the&nbsp;Sonoma&nbsp;Cutter. I was surprised that the internet bids ran it up to over $300 to start. </div>
