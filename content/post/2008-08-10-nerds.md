# Nerds: Who they are and why we need more of them
David Anderegg Ph.D.


I wish I had read this book in high school. Would have explained things and made them easier to deal with. I suspect I have identified the thing that made me "different" but that is a post for a later date.


"Illness, then as now, carries with it the notion of lack of culpability along with the potential for cure."  
pg. 107


"If one of the stigmas of the dyed-in-the-wool nerd or geek is the inability to know who is interested ad who is not interested in one's own peculiar passions...this inability should be content-neutral"  
pg. 145


"So a simple answer to the problem of tech man and his cultural icon is that it is difficult to portray or show a romantic picture of what technology workers do...."Well he doesn't jump around too much, but his thoughts do! Look at those numbers dance!""  
pg. 149-150
