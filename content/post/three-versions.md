There is a well known adage that three versions exist to any disagreement. What the first party believes happened, what the second party believed happened and the truth. As a corollary to this I have always felt that when it came to news from Israel by reading the Haaretz, Jerusalem Post and Arutz Sheva somewhere in the middle would be what really happened.<br /><br />With my recent trip to Israel and the recent happenings in Amona I think this system is coming under attack. Many other bloggers have thrown their comments into the ring and I've had a great time reading them all. The one thing that gets me is one sideness of people on either end of the spectrum. You can't go around peddling one video of the police hitting the protestors and not respond to the video of the protestors throwing stones and the police. In the same vein you can't fisk a video that contradicts a politician's version of events without reacting to the wanton violence of the day.<br /><br />The entire situation simply solidifies my belief that you can look at any event or statement and spin it to match your agenda. In the end the left will see it as lawlessness and the right will see it as brutality, regardless of the various contradictions and hypocrisies that result.
